The most common way to make price predictions is to use technical analysis. Technical analysis is the practice of using chart patterns and indicators to identify trends and make predictions. By looking at the data, one can identify the current trend and use it to predict future prices. For example, if the data shows that the price is trending upwards, one can predict that the price will continue to move up in the future. Additionally, one can also use technical indicators such as moving averages or support and resistance levels to identify potential entry and exit points.=>
